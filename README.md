# JAVA-SHREDDER
I love the linux shred utility, so why not make a directory shredder?
This shredder is more of an "overwriter". It overwrites the given file 3 times then deletes the file.  

NOTE: This program does not change any metadata or affect the files on a binary level; using "shred -uz *" is generally more secure.

I am not responible for code misuse.
