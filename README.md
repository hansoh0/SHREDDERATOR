# JAVA-SHREDDER
I love the linux shred utility, so why not make a directory shredder?
This shredder is more of an "overwriter"; it overwrites the given file 3 times, zeros it, then removes it from the machines directory listing.  

NOTE: This program does not change any metadata.

I am not responsible for code misuse.
