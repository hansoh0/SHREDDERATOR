# JAVA-SHREDDER
I love the linux shred utility, so why not make a directory shredder?
This shredder is more of an "overwriter"; it overwrites the given file 3 times then removes it from the machines directory listing.  

NOTE: This program does not change any metadata, affect the files on a binary level, or "zero the file"; using "shred -uz *" is generally more secure.

I am not responible for code misuse.
